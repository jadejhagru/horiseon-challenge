# Code Refactor Starter Code

Hello Horiseon Team!

    It has been a pleasure to be working with you today and I would like to thank you again for giving me this exciting opportunity!I have found small errors in your code and have fixed them as best as I see fit to meet all of your accessbility and acceptance criteria. Below you will find a list of things I have corrected and simplified followed by a URL to the new website.

    Cheers!

> I changed the webiste <title> to "Horiseon".
> Some meta tag information was missed, so I added that for proper accessability. 
> Cleaned up your <h1> tag. I personally didn't find it necessary to have a <span> in the title as I thought it made it look unprofessional having "Horiseon" in two dfferent shades of white.
> Cleaned up code slightly with indentation throughout "html.index" and "style.css".
> Added new <!--comments--> throughout the "html.index" file. 
> <Class="hero"> was changed to <class="meeting"> for less confusion.
> Added necessary <alt> tags for accessability.
> Seqences of <header> tags weren't correct so <h2> in the <footer> tag was changed to <h4>
> Deleed the Develop" folder so website is more accessable for other developers.
